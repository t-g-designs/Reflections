When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want a remote repository if you would be using different computers for the project or if you had multiple users.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to control the files you're working on. If you were collaborating with a group and they changed the files through Github, you wouldn't want Git to automatically pull them to your local repository in case you were currently working on the same file and had made your own changes.
