What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates an empty repository in the directorty you are in and creates a .git file. You can then commit to the repository so you can keep track of your changes easily.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary place that git keeps files before committing them. It lets you decide which files you want to commit and gives you an opportunity to see which files and change your mind before committing them.
